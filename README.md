### Automated Invoicing Solution

#### Inspired by [Invoice-O-Matic](http://www.invoiceomatic.io), this is an invoicing tool that simplifies invoice making/archiving easier. I made it for a friend's auto dealership business.

Invoice-O-Matic is a demoware, by FreeAgent, for people to try before buying a whole suite of tools for business management. As with any demoware, there are limitations to what you can do with Invoice-O-Matic, so my friend asked me to make an invoicing tool similar to it but with more freedom.

He liked the idea of Invoice-O-Matic but wanted something with more automation. For example Invoice-O-Matic didn't store the files in a database for later use, it was the user's responsibility to name and store the invoice files, which meant they had to keep track of names they had used to be able to maintain a clean and tidy archive so that they can find any invoices later when they needed them. But as a business owner, he didn't have the time to maintain a database manually.
 Invoice-O-Matic also didn't keep track of your email and/or allow you to set default values for some fields such as the company information and sender email, so he had to do that every time he made an invoice and it's just really tedious.
