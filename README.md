# Invoice-Maker
### Automated Invoicing Solution

A friend of mine who runs an autodealership business needed an invoicing tool that would help him make and archive invoices in an easier fashion, there are many paid and free invoicing solutions out there but he couldn't find that did everything he needed. 
So I made him the Invoice Maker. It's a simple invoice form webpage made with HTML-CSS and JS, using PHP and SQL, the Invoice Maker turns the completed invoice into a pdf then proceeds to save it on a database where it's properly named for easy retrieval when you need it, and a copy of it is sent to the approperiate customer. The invoice form is designed to meet his needs specifically (auto-dealership), as you can see there are no fields to set company information for the header of the form, that's because it's hard coded in the php, I wanted to leave as little fields on the page as possible so that he could get invoices faster, however I may change my mind and add the extra fields later, so that people can use it as a more general purpose invoicing tool.
